        Myself and three of my fellow students at CSUMB took on this project as our end of program project. We were the only team in our cohort to get a project that was from a local industry partner. 
        <br><br>
        We worked with Drs. Angel Liang and Rupert Yan to create a companion android app for the board game Empower Empathy. The board game aims to help players better understand each other in a casual and fun format. 
        <br><br>
        The android application was meant to provide players with an interactive experience, allowing them to play a game similar to Heads-Up, engage with a vast quantity of thought-provoking ice-breaker questions, and even interact with an AI chatbot that was adept at discussing issues surrounding human emotions.

        The largest issue I had to overcome with this project was working with technologies that I had no prior experience with. Refining the AI chatbot to engage better with people potentially asking for mental health support was exceptionally challenging. Through it all though, I feel as though I greatly improved upon my ability to teach myself how to solve complication issues using the people around me and internet resources!
