    <p>
      I grew up in Santa Cruz, California. I graduated from Harbor High School in May of 2016. Upon graduation, I knew that I wanted to be an engineer, I just hadn't known what specific field I wanted to pursue an education in. When I began college at Cabrillo Community College, I was sure that I wanted to be an aerospace engineer. Space had always fascinated me as a child and the thought of working with a company such as NASA had always been a dream of mine.

      In 2020, I had to evacuate my house in the Santa Cruz Mountains due to the CZU fire. In this time, my partner nudged me to take a beginning C++ class. From there, I knew for sure what I wanted to do. Delving into programming has been such a fun adventure for me. It has allowed me to fully experience one of my most favorite hobbies - tinkering with embedded circuits! Changing my major led to me becomming the first person in my family to get a bachelor's degree! I graduated in December, 2024 from California State University Monterey Bay with a bachelor's degree in computer science!
    <br><br>
      At this stage of my life, I am looking for employment opportunities so that I can settle down with my partner and enjoy spending our lives together and creating a family. I'm beyond excited to learn more about the computer science field and continue taking away as many experiences as I can!
